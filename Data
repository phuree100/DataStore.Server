* Pallet physics lock trigger extended down
* Attachable things' collision can be toggled with the reload key (default: R)
* Attach mode can be toggled with Shift+R (holding run and pressing reload)
to attach the object's the closest point or its origin, so it's no longer per item
* It is now saved where physics locked things are locked, 
so far physics lock triggers just locked quickly whatever was in them at load,
and baskets have higher priority, than trunks and such,
these may make physics lock storages more convenient to use
* Fixed being able to remove the license plate through the car
And a maybe mod related bug

v2023.04.19c:

* Bikes driving got much better, they spin less likely and should be less jumpy,
and their keyboard steering speed decreases less at higher speeds
* Removed not being able to drink or pour from heavy containers

* Pallets do not physics lock new things while picked up
to make it easier to move them around without grabbing random things
but already locked things will stay on it

* Adjusted fridge collider very slightly
* Raised Car02 and Car02k's suspension
(couldn't stiffen it :( that made it roll over)
* Increased the car hauler's rear wheels sideways friction to spin a bit less likely
(that too rolled over with even more friction)
* Since the new menu, you can have old saves from before the menu with the same name as a save after it
This is because some invisible character got added to the name of the save
Which I removed now, so now everything is back to normal
(except that you now can have same named saves from before and after this update)

closest point to the closest point on the looked at surface, not exactly to the point
you look at

v2023.04.14c:

* Fixed not being able to attach trailers
(broke with the previous fix)

v2023.04.14b:

* Fixed licence plate and other attachables not loading correctly
when attached to the slots or the bike seats

because they no longer use their center, but their closest point for attaching
* Bikes's steering with keyboard slower on higher speeds
and they should bounce slightly less

(hopefully for real this time)
* Disabled the annoying unity developer console
(it will come back next time I forgot to uncheck it)

* added a cap
* added fridge
* added new car(s)
* added 3D VLC icon

* cigarettes are now working
* game's size got decreased by about 50%

* Fixed crash on loading a save in which one basket is in an other which is in the first one...

(thank you for the bug reports and save files you sent, without them I couldn't have fix these)


v2021.06.05:

* Added ammo for the revolver, you can now reload it
(if you load an older version save you will not have ammo in you weapons,

So from now on the car will really be lighter without bumpers, doors, you...
* The moped's balance got much better
* Attaching and removing license plates got a lot more easier
* The moped's basket is now attachable to anywhere
and the items you store in it won't fall out unless you pick them up,
like in the truck's fuel can holder
(it only works if the item is not falling out as soon as you release it,
it has to stay there a litte bit, and then the physics is removed)
* Same with the gloveboxes in every vehicle
* You can now coil up the siphon hose a bit (by holding R)
so it is easier to put it in the glovebox

* small script optimizations and even smaller model optimizations

* Fixed transmission stick not cleaning in the previous new car
* handbrakes and lights can now be turned on/off with E

* if you put a txt in the game's data folder named: "usb.txt"
and write a port name in it (example: "COM5")
